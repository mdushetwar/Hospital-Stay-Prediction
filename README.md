# Hospital-Stay-Prediction

### Software and tools Requirements

1. [Github Account](http://github.com)
2. [VSCode](http://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
4. [GitDesktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

Create a new environment for the project

'''
conda create -p venv python==3.7 -y
'''


Since the dataset is large, some of the code takes significant amount of time to run. It is desirable to run the code using cloud computing power such as Goolge Colab. Otherwise the it can take a lot of time with heating the devices.


During the model development, number of experiments were conducted with data processing. A short summary of these experiments is provided in the Appendix section at the end.


### How to run Web-application?
